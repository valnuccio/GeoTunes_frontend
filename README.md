### What is this app?
 This is a React FrontEnd / Rails Back End app for the intended purpose of using direction rendering together with Spotify playlists to create customizatized jogging and walking routes. You will be prompted to authenticate your Spotify acct upon signing in, at which point you may listen to playlist/routes others have made, or create/edit/post your own!

 ### What makes this app unique?

 The routes created are meant to be paired with the tracks to create an immersive experience. Have a road trip playlist? Sync it up and follow the directions at the same time. Then share it with your friends so they can take the same trip.
